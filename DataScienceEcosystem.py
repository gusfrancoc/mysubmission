# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# __Objectives:__
# 
# * List popular languages for Data Science
# * List common used libraries by Data Scientists
# * List popular Data Science Tools
# * Examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[36]:


# Arithmetic operations
code = compile("(3*4)+5", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code)
# Result: 9


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[35]:


# Arithmetic operations
code = compile("200/60", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code)
# Result: 9
